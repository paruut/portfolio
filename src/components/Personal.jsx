          I would describe myself as an ambitious, highly productive, and
          effective individual, constantly striving for self-development and
          eager to broaden my horizons. As a self-taught frontend developer, I
          embrace new technologies with enthusiasm and see programming as both
          my passion and a source of immense pleasure in my work. I have a
          strong commitment to continuous learning, always seeking to enhance my
          skills and explore new libraries to become an even more proficient
          developer. Constructive criticism is something I value greatly, as it
          helps me refine my craft and aligns with my professional goals. I am
          currently seeking a permanent position to apply and further develop
          these skills in a professional setting.
