          I am an ambitious and highly productive frontend developer with a
          strong commitmentto self-development and continuous learning.
          Passionate about programming, I embrace new technologies
          enthusiastically and find immense pleasure in my work. As a
          self-taught developer, I actively seek opportunities to enhance my
          skills and explore new libraries, striving to become even more
          proficientin my craft. I greatly value constructive criticism, as it
          helps me refine my skills and align with my professional goals.
          Currently, I am seeking a permanent position where I can apply my
          skills in a professional setting and continue my growth as a
          developer.
